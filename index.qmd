  Nepal Center for Cognition and Society (NCCS)
  is an independent, not-for-profit research organization founded in Bhadrapur, a south-east town of Nepal. 
  We are researchers with diverse backgrounds in cognitive and psychological sciences, neuroscience, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, sociology, and health sciences.
  We aim to understand cognition and cognitive processes in humans and animals using behavioral, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and computational methods and tools in multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams.
