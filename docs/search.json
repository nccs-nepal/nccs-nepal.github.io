    "text": "Nepal Center for Cognition and Society (NCCS) is an independent not-for-profit academic research organization founded in Bhadrapur, a south-east town of Nepal. At NCCS, we aspire to conduct state-of-the-art scientific research to forge a comprehensive understanding of human cognition and cognitive processes, placing Nepal on the world map of science. NCCS will be one of the few non-government, not-for-profit research institutes regularly publishing in prestigious international journals, training national and international students, and producing innovation. At NCCS, we prioritize the free flow of ideas among our researchers and maintain intellectual freedom unconstrained by research domain, nationality, age, or gender.\nWe bring together experts from various fields ‚Äì neuroscience, linguistics, psychology, computer science and AI, philosophy, and health sciences ‚Äì to study human cognition in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary teams. Researchers at NCCS collaborate with each other and with labs in universities and industries across the globe to study consciousness, cognitive consequences of multilingualism and meditation, executive control, cognitive aging, language comprehension, predictive language processing, and neurodevelopmental conditions like Autism, among others.\nAt a time when the psychological and cognitive sciences are going through a replication crisis, we carry out research on the non-WEIRD population in the Nepali context. This will be a crucial building block in the knowledge base of human cognition while testing the validity of the ‚Äúwell-established‚Äù findings.\nAlong with research, science education is our foundational pillar. We aim to make the public aware of scientific methodology. We train students across all levels of school and college to inspire the next generation of scientists to lead innovation and discovery in the global landscape from Nepal. We believe that it is vital for the nation‚Äôs future to foster a research culture and scientific thinking among school-going children.\nOur scientists, teachers, and staff will strive to make a better future for the generation to come by creating knowledge and contributing to science, technology, and innovation.\nThings to know:\n\nWe are not-for-profit. Our activities are driven by the motivation of producing scientific knowledge and public service.\nWe are independent. We are not affiliated with any other agency, institution, organization, or company.\nWe support science communication and STEM education. We train school students on science and research methodology and spread awareness among the public about scientific methods.\nWe are open to collaboration to achieve these goals."

    "text": "Our Mission\n\nMake a significant contribution to the advancement of psychological and cognitive sciences putting Nepal on the global map of science\nEducate and inspire school-going children ‚Äì scientists of the next generation ‚Äì to lead the global research and innovation from Nepal\n\n\n\nOur Values\nWe believe that there should be no gatekeeping in science. Everyone, regardless of their age, gender, or caste, should have equal opportunity to participate in science education and research. We strive to conduct research that is free from any gatekeeping. We also speak through our research against any gatekeeping in academic research or research community. We are aware and mindful of the fact that some communities (e.g., women and Dalits) have been historically discriminated against, and the constitution warrants positive discrimination to uplift them.\nPsychological and cognitive sciences face the so-called replication crisis on the one hand and the problem of basing the findings only on the WEIRD population on the other hand. These crises and problems are not unfounded. Particularly those cognitive scientists who have first-hand experience conducting research in both the Global South and the North can attest that not all the findings from the North are replicable in the South and there may be many reasons for that ‚Äì from cultural differences to flawed original research. At NCCS, we believe it is imperative to collaborate with the original author and pursue a replication in the local context where applicable.\nDoing research in Nepal is challenging. The challenges are amplified for cognitive science research as government funding for academic research is virtually unavailable. We have to adapt to Nepal‚Äôs scenario of underfunded research. Hence, we also request international funding agencies to collaborate with us and fund our research. We also urge the public to participate in and crowdfund for our research. This approach applies to Nepal‚Äôs unique situation.\nThere is a limited number of cognitive scientists in the country. Thus, we are establishing collaboration with experts from universities and labs across the globe while also conducting cross-cultural studies. Our students will get an opportunity to be mentored by scientists from across the world. We believe that inspiring next-generation scientists is important for the country‚Äôs future.\nWe will create a sustainable and collaborative research environment where the flow of ideas among students and senior scientists is not restrained by hierarchy, area of expertise, or other factors. We will collaborate with government agencies, private industries, and corporations. By doing so, we will not only add to the knowledge of the scientific field but also provide consultation on a policy level."

The goal of the 1-day retreat is to plan the long-term sustainability of the Mentors community from both the governance and technical side.\nThe NASA Openscapes Mentor Retreat will be in Burlington, Vermont on Monday, July 17 before the ESIP Summer Meeting, July 18-21. We will also provide the opportunity for the Mentors to attend the ESIP Meeting in order to network and learn from the broader community.
