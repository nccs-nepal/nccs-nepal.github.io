Nepal Center for Cognition and Society (NCCS)
is an independent not-for-profit academic research organization founded in Bhadrapur, a south-east town of Nepal. At NCCS, we aspire to conduct state-of-the-art scientific research to forge a comprehensive understanding of *human cognition* and *cognitive processes*, placing Nepal on the world map of science. NCCS will be one of the few non-government, not-for-profit research institutes regularly publishing in prestigious international journals, training national and international students, and producing innovation. At NCCS, we prioritize the free flow of ideas among our researchers and maintain intellectual freedom unconstrained by research domain, nationality, age, or gender.

We bring together experts from various fields – *neuroscience*, *linguistics*, *psychology*, *computer science* and *AI*, *philosophy*, and *health sciences* – to study human cognition in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary teams. Researchers at NCCS collaborate with each other and with labs in universities and industries across the globe to study *consciousness*, cognitive consequences of *multilingualism* and *meditation*, *executive control*, *cognitive aging*, *language comprehension*, *predictive language processing*, and *neurodevelopmental conditions* like Autism, among others.

At a time when the psychological and cognitive sciences are going through a replication crisis, we carry out research on the non-WEIRD population in the Nepali context. This will be a crucial building block in the knowledge base of human cognition while testing the validity of the "well-established" findings.

Along with research, science education is our foundational pillar. We aim to make the public aware of scientific methodology. We train students across all levels of school and college to inspire the next generation of scientists to lead innovation and discovery in the global landscape from Nepal. We believe that it is vital for the nation's future to foster a research culture and scientific thinking among school-going children.

Our scientists, teachers, and staff will strive to make a better future for the generation to come by creating knowledge and contributing to science, technology, and innovation.

**Things to know**:

- We are not-for-profit. Our activities are driven by the motivation of producing scientific knowledge and public service. 
- We are independent. We are not affiliated with any other agency, institution, organization, or company.
- We support science communication and STEM education. We train school students on science and research methodology and spread awareness among the public about scientific methods.
- We are open to collaboration to achieve these goals.
