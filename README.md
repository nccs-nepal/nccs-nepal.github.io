### Nepal Center for Cognition and Society

[nccs-nepal.github.io](https://nccs-nepal.github.io/)

NCCS is a multidisciplinary research center based in Nepal.

We study human cognition using behavioral and electrophysiological methods and computational modeling, and cover topics that span across multilingualism, speech comprehension in prosthetic hearing, and neurodevelopmental disorders, among others.

In collaboration with researchers at home and abroad, we aim to establish ourselves as the center of excellence in understanding human cognition and cognitive processes.

At this early stage of founding the institute, we invite collaborators, funders, and well-wishers to contribute to our growth and development in any form they can.
